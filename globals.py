"""This library defines the global plugin states, based on the POSIX
spec of returning a positive value and just like in
`monitoring-plugins/plugins-scripts/utils.sh.in`, except that we do not
make use of `STATE_DEPENDENT`.

STATE_OK = 0: The plugin was able to check the service and it appeared
to be functioning properly.

STATE_WARN = 1: The plugin was able to check the service, but it
appeared to be above some "warning" threshold or did not appear to be
working properly.

STATE_CRIT = 2: The plugin detected that either the service was not
running or it was above some "critical" threshold.

STATE_UNKNOWN = 3: Invalid command line arguments were supplied to the
plugin or low-level failures internal to the plugin (such as unable to
fork, or open a tcp socket) that prevent it from performing the
specified operation. Higher-level errors (such as name resolution
errors, socket timeouts, etc) are outside of the control of plugins and
should generally NOT be reported as UNKNOWN states.
